<h3>(1) <a href= "https://github.com/tnmasui/Projects/tree/master/InsideAirbnb" >Regression Model on Inside Airbnb data with Spark MLlib</a></h3>

In this project, I analyzed <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">"Inside Airbnb" data</a> to identify what factor affects property's rating to provide useful direction for users to choose better property or for property owners to increase rating score. To achieve that, I incorpolated this huge data into HDFS, <a href= "https://github.com/tnmasui/Projects/blob/master/InsideAirbnb/Preprocess_Hive.hql">manipulated data with Hive</a>, and <a href= "https://github.com/tnmasui/Projects/blob/master/InsideAirbnb/Regression_MLlib_Scala.txt">developed regression model by MLlib in Spark</a>. The following chart shows what factors are the most significant for ratings.
