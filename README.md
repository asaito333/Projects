(X) Analyzing Inside Airbnb data
Our project team analyzed "Inside Airbnb" data to identify what factor affects property's rating and develop property clusters which categorises properties by having similar features to provide useful direction for users or property owners to choose better property or increase rating score. To achieve that, we incorpolated the data into HDFS and manipulate data by Hive and develop regression model by MLlib in Spark. The following chart shows what factors are most significant for ratins.
